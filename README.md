# Personal Website
Website all about me built with React.js and Gatsby.js! This website served as an opportunity for me to learn React, as well as have an area to document various projects that I am working on.

## Deployment
CI/CD is used to automate the build and deploy stages of this website. CircleCI is used to run builds, and the static files are hosted on GitHub Pages. The website also references my CV from an AWS S3 bucket, which always contains the latest version of my CV (LaTeX source also built and deployed with CI/CD).
